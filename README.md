## What is This?

See https://cogdog.github.io/permutator for a "stunning" demo where you can see maybe what "COGDOG" stands for?

This is github based SPLOT for randomizing the possible words to make up nebulous acronyms like SPLOT first done in a hard coded way at https://splot.ca -- GIF version here

Ah, but now we have a new twist. Rather than having the word choices being hard coded in a file, they can be fetched from external, even remote json data files.

Try this reproduction of the original SPLOT mix

https://cogdog.github.io/permutator/?wordsrc=js/splot.json

and a favorite pal

Or even... (this is not working yet...)

## Specifications for JSON Format

TBA, maybe a tool to build it?
