## What is this?

See https://cogdog.github.io/permutator for a "stunning" demo


A github based splot for randomizing acronyms like at https://splot.ca -- right now a proof of concept.

Ultimately, in a not too distant future, you could make your own by:

* fork this baby
* providing a URL parameter to a JSON file with all the parameters (word lists, background image URL, title, CSS settings). Possibly a fotm generator here to build, test, create the json
